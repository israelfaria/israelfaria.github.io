# The Start
Hi, my name is Israel and I'm a software developer living in Brazil. Few months
back I've started my own indie company which I called Philosoftware. I work
mostly on websites and I have a few ambitions for the future that I'll be
posting here. Right now I'm getting acquainted with Jekyll, Github Pages, and
Cloudflare services. This is the setup I choose to host this website.
